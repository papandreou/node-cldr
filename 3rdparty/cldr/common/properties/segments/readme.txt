The segments directory contains files used to customize the default segmentation data in the UCD. 

Currently this just applies to the Grapheme Cluster Break (GCB) (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) algorithm,
which was used in CLDR 35..43 to add support for not splitting Indic aksaras.
Unicode 15.1 has adoped these changes.
Starting with CLDR 44, the GraphemeBreakTest.* files are the same as in the UCD.
